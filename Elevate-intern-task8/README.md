# Sales Performance Dashboard

This project is part of Task 8 for the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an interactive visualization of sales data to help analyze performance across different dimensions.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard visualizes sales data by product category, region, and month, featuring:

- A line chart showing Sales over Months
- A bar chart displaying sales by region
- A donut chart illustrating sales distribution by category
- Slicers for filtering by Region and Category to enhance interactivity
